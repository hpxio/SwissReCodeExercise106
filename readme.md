# Code Exercise 106

# Assumptions Taken

- JDK 17 - Since it was not mentioned explicitly, I opted to go with 17. No specific reason but I can make use of records along with already present Stream API from previous versions.
- Junit 5 - Using Jupiter API for unit testing, same reason, that the version wasn't mentioned and this library is latest.

_TBD_
