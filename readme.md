# Code Exercise 106

## Assumptions Taken

- **JDK 17** - Since it was not mentioned explicitly, I opted to go with 17. No specific reason but I can make use of records along with already present Stream API from previous versions.
- **Junit 5** - Using Jupiter API for unit testing, same reason, that the version wasn't mentioned and this library is latest.
- **Jacoco** - Added to see code coverage
- **Logging** - Using `System.out.println()` for logging as restriction on using only Java SE packages

## TBD

### Models & User-defined Types

### Tests & Coverage

### Scope for Optimization

### Complexity Analysis per Operation

- Reading the File Content

- Calculating Hierarchy (Depth) 

- Managers Earning Less

- Managers Earning More

- Depth Analysis
